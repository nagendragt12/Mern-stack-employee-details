# Step 1: Project Initialization with Vite

To begin, let’s create a new project folder and initialize Vite. Vite is a powerful front-end tool that streamlines project setup. Open your terminal and execute the following commands:
```
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm init vite
```

# Step 2: Install Dependencies
Move into the “client” folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd client
npm install
npm install bootstrap axios react-router-dom
```
# Step 3: Run the React Js
```
npm run dev
```

# Step 4: Node.js Express setup

```
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors nodemon
```
# Step 5 : Node js run
```
node index.js
```
